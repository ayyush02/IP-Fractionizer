# IP Fractionalizer

A decentralized platform built on Aptos blockchain for fractional ownership of intellectual property, starting with patents.

## Project Overview

IP Fractionalizer enables:
- Tokenization of patents into fungible tokens
- Fractional ownership and trading of patent rights
- Automated royalty distribution to token holders
- Governance through DAO mechanisms
- Integration with Aptos DeFi protocols

## Smart Contracts

### PatentToken
- Implements the Aptos token standard
- Manages fractional ownership of patents
- Handles token transfers and balances

### RoyaltyDistributor
- Automatically distributes royalties to token holders
- Tracks patent income and payments
- Implements fair distribution algorithms

### Governance
- Enables token holder voting
- Manages licensing decisions
- Implements DAO mechanisms

## Frontend Features

- Patent registration and tokenization
- Token purchase interface
- Royalty dashboard
- DeFi protocol integrations
- Wallet connection (Petra)
- Responsive and user-friendly UI

## DeFi Integrations

- Liquidswap: Trading and liquidity pools
- Meso Finance: Lending and borrowing
- Staking mechanisms for governance
